Application of Various Machine Learning Algorithms
This work proposed data exploratory techniques (DET) and developed four different predictive models to improve breast cancer diagnostic accuracy. Prior to models, four-layered essential DET, e.g., feature distribution, correlation, elimination were deep-dived to identify the robust feature classification into malignant and benign classes.
